# Deeplearning-exercises
This repository has described about the exrcises that I have built to practice for building the deep learning model with different framework and different network architecutre.
The dataset has been borrowed from Kaggle ('https://www.kaggle.com')

## Folder1. Pytorch
This forder consists of the examples that have been used the Pytorch framework to build the CNN model, and solve the classification task using the DenseNet. Both of the exmaples contains the data pre-processing , training, evaluation part. Since both examples are the classification task, Confusion matrix and classification report has been used to describe the perpormance of the model. 



## Folder2. TransferLearning
This folder has xonsists of the examples that have been used the tensorflow framework to build the transfer learning model. Similar as the Folder1, the exercisese contains the whole pipeline of the model and visualization.
