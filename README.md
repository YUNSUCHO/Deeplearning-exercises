# Deeplearning-exercises
This repository has described about the exrcises that I have built to practice for building the deep learning model with different framework and different network architecutre.
The dataset has been borrowed from Kaggle ('https://www.kaggle.com')

## Folder1. Pytorch
This forder consists of the examples that have been used the Pytorch framework to build the CNN model, and solve the classification task using the DenseNet. Both of the exmaples contains the data pre-processing , training, evaluation part. Since both examples are the classification task, Confusion matrix and classification report has been used to describe the perpormance of the model. 



## Folder2. TransferLearning
This folder has consists of the examples that have been used the tensorflow framework to build the model with transfer learning. For that purpose, the pre-trained resnet_50, efficientnet_b4 network has been appied with the given datasets. Similar as the Folder1, the exercisese contains the whole pipeline of the model and visualization. Moreover, the exercises in this folder has tried to explore different data visualization ways for example, bar graph or pie chart, and so on.
